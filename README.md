# Healthcare Innovaction 

## Universal Electronic Health Record 

This is a product being built by the Assembly community. You can help push this idea forward by visiting [https://assembly.com/healthcare-innovaction](https://assembly.com/healthcare-innovaction).

### How Assembly Works

Assembly products are like open-source and made with contributions from the community. Assembly handles the boring stuff like hosting, support, financing, legal, etc. Once the product launches we collect the revenue and split the profits amongst the contributors.

### Technology  
I'm looking to build in either Ruby or PHP. We need to use a secured, and scalable language.

### HIPPA Compliance 
We are a PI (Personal Information) Level Health application. To keep our application compliant, we need to make sure we can prove we can't access and (PI) data. 

### Data Storage 
We can use a (SaaS) type data storage. Placing healthcare facility's into their own data containers. Healthcare facility's are owned in groups. So imaging signing a contract with one company, and then having 120 facility's around the US to serve. But healthcare company A (120 facility's) data will be separate from company B (82 facility's).

### Developers 
I'm more of a products guy, so I'm looking forwarded to working with talented frontend developers. Just google search (hospital) or (nursing home) EHR's, and you'll see all of the ugly applications. This application will be a massive leap for facility's into future/present time. 

### API
I don't know if this is something important to create in the beginning. But the ability to connect our software to wireless monitoring devices is huge. Have partnerships will company's in the valley like Cellscope is huge.
